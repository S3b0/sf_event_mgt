#. Include the static TypoScript configuration “Event management and registration (sf\_event\_mgt)” in your TypoScript template

#. Create a new sysfolder in your page tree, where you create events and categories.

#. Depending on your needs, create a TYPO3 page for event listing, event details and event registration.

#. Add the plugin :ref:`eventplugin-settings` to the newly created pages and configure the plugin settings.

#. Configure extension TypoScript settings depending on your needs.

#. Optionally add the plugin :ref:`userregistrationplugin-settings` to a page, to show registered frontend users their event registrations
